  This is an eval test:
  <?eval?>
    <?eval?>
      But this is going to work, however it still
      should not appear in the final result because
      it's within an eval that fails
    <?endeval errormsg="huh oh, problem, this should not appear"?>
    <?var name="this/aint/gonna/work"?>
  <?endeval errormsg="should appear"?>

  <span petal:on-error="string:booo">$this/aint/gonna/work</span>
</test>
